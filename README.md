Recap:-
condtions(if, else,else if, switch, ternary).
condition ? <true situation> : <false situation>

--Else if ladder:- if,else if, else if, else if.
3. Nesting(One inside another).
4. Recap of loops (for, while, do while).
- Difference between while and do while (Do while will execute atleast once, while will check first and than execute).
- While is an entery controlled loop.
- Do while is exit controlled loop.
5. Difference between == and ===.
- == check value. (Regular comparison)
- === checks value and data type. (Strict Equality)
- = Assignment Operator.

!=  (Not equal to) (Regular)
!== (Not equal with data type) (Strickt equality).

6. Recap of function.
- Define once, use(invoke/call) multiple time.
- code reusability
- used to implement some sort of logic.
- They take some input an give some output.

7. Data Type :- Object
- The seqence does not matter.
- The DATA can be any order.
- Objects takes Keys as String only. If we give anything else, it will CONVERT (.toString()) under the hood.
- Object.key(new_obj) and object.values(new_obj)

9. Connect function to HTML Document.
